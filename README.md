## Introduction

The active suspension system project aims to enhance the performance of tractor suspension systems by actively controlling the suspension parameters. This approach helps in reducing the vibrations and improving the stability and comfort of the tractor.

## Project Structure

- `code/` - Contains the MATLAB/Simulink code used for the project.
- `report/` - Contains the final report detailing the project methodology, design, and results.
- `data/` - Contains any data files used or generated during the project.
- `docs/` - Additional documentation related to the project.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to have MATLAB and Simulink installed. Follow the steps below to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mohammaddjalili/Active-suspension-system.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Active-suspension-system
    ```
3. Open MATLAB and add the project directory to your MATLAB path.

## Usage

1. Open the MATLAB/Simulink model files located in the `code/` directory.
2. Run the simulation to observe the performance of the active suspension system.
3. Modify the parameters as needed to explore different scenarios and configurations.

## Results

The results of the simulations, including performance metrics and visualizations, are detailed in the `report/` directory. The report includes:

- System design and modeling
- Simulation results
- Analysis of the active suspension system's performance
